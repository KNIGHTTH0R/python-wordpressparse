## Python Wordpress Export Parser
Takes a Wordpress XML export and parses it to Python objects (and also lists right now).

Usage is available in the ```example.py``` file.  At the moment some methods return lists and others return objects; this will be rectified in another release.

This is alpha software.  Please read the code first.

### Usage Scenarios
This library was written to import a Wordpress export into Tumblr, post by post.  Use it to import into other systems, or do an analysis on your export (how many tags per post do I have on average?) or whatever pleases you.
